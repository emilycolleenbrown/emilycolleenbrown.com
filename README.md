## Editing the theme
* A lot of the main details are editable in the `_config.yml` file. Colors, fonts, etc are editable in `css/` folder.

## Editing or creating content
* When you create a new markdown file, say `about.md` in the root directory (not inside any folders)
  of the repository. It will then be accessible like
  `emilycolleenbrown.com/about`.

* To add posts, add your posts in the `_posts` directory. Follow
  the naming convention `%yyyy-%mm-%dd-your-title-here.md`. You can copy this logic here, or duplicate an existing page.
