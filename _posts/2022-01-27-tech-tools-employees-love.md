I interviewed BrainStorm's Director of LX Design Kristen Hubler for the first post in a series called Tech Tools Employees Love, focused on asking BrainStorm employees what tools help them streamline and plan so they can focus on the most fulfilling and productive parts of their work life. I love interviewing passionate people and Kristen is no exceptionâ€”I regularly think about her intention-first approach to time management.
