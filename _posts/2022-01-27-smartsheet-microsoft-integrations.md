This is a piece I put together describing all the different ways Microsoft 365 can integrate with Smartsheetâ€”and there are many. I think what interested me most about this piece was researching overlap between the two companies, and the way that Smartsheet and Microsoft have specifically partnered together to integrate their softwares in useful ways.
