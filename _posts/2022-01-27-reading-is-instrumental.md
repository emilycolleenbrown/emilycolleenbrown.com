I wrote descriptions and marketing collateral for the first season of Reading Is Instrumental, a musical storytime series hosted by the Berkeley Public Library Foundation and the Berkeley Symphony. I collaborated with staff from the Symphony and the Berkeley Public Library to create meaningful copy, social media posts, and other marketing materials.
