Gregory Barnes' The Touch of the Master's Hand is a Mormon movie, a twelve-minute short about a young missionary ashamed of his masturbation habit. It premiered at the 2021 Sundance Film Festival and won the Short Film Jury Award for U.S. Fiction. I interviewed Greg, condensed our conversation for clarity, then worked with editor Clement Obropta to fine-tune this piece.
