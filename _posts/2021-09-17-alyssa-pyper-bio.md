Experimental folk musician Alyssa Pyper and I are both members of indie record label Song Club Records, and in preparation for her first album release I worked with her on a narrative bio that we sent to journalists and music critics. We used images of the Great Salt Lake and recurring lyrical motifs from her album to craft a powerful introduction to listeners that represents Alyssa's dynamic musical style.
