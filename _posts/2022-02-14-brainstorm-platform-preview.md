This landing page served as a hub for BrainStorm's soft launch of a new educational platform. BrainStorm launched a preview of the platform on a limited basis to current customers. I worked with the marketing team to craft excited, fresh messaging that conveyed changes to the platform's design and functionality and the benefits of previewing the new platform. This landing page served to generate excitement about signing up to use the preview ahead of the platform's launch. I wrote and edited copy for this preview landing page as well as a shareable fact sheet with a condensed version of the same information.
